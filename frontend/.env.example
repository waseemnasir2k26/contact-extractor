# Frontend Environment Variables
# IMPORTANT: Set this in Vercel dashboard under Environment Variables for production!

# For local development:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For production (REQUIRED - set in Vercel Environment Variables):
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
#
# Without this, the app will try to use /api which won't work
# since the backend is deployed separately.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Deploy backend to Render (or similar)
# 2. Copy the backend URL
# 3. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
# 4. Add VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
